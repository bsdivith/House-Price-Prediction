# House Price Prediction

This project is an implementation of the first project from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*. It follows the exact procedures outlined in the book to predict house prices using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for house prices using real estate data. The steps include:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Final model deployment

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional)
It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the entire workflow:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

Open the relevant notebook and follow the steps outlined in the book.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from the book. Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. Follow the book’s instructions to download and place it in the `data/` directory.
